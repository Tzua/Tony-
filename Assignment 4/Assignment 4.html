    <p><b>Travelling in Depression</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents
      first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine
      different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.
      <br>

      <p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first begin interested
        in language. At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights.
        When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco Feeding hordes
        of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen,
        I saw the ancient, Megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along
        the Great Wall of china,amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still
        in place.It was through exploring

        height="230px" align="left"> It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation.
        I Remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was.
        But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more
        Accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered. In the eighth grade, I became
        fascinated with Spanish and aware of its Similarities with English through
        cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is Béisbol, which looks different
        but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible To me as it made speech
        and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find That cognates come
        to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. Then, in high
        school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at
        my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a Character,
        the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by Combining simpler
        characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning Mountain can be
        joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love Spending hours
        at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm
        as I form them.</p>
